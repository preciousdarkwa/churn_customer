Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.\n","\n","**Balance**—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.\n","\n","**NumOfProducts**—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.\n","\n","**HasCrCard**—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.\n","\n","**IsActiveMember**—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.\n","\n","**EstimatedSalary**—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.\n","\n","**Exited**—whether or not the customer left the bank.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"piugVSIH8-h8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763217588595,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":34374,"user":{"displayName":"precious darkwa","userId":"11348638090807503556"}},"outputId":"90d653ed-3660-42f3-adba-6a86b317913e"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AsM-UZzFLU6K"},"source":["## **KNN**\n","\n","The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and effective machine learning technique that classifies data points by finding the K most similar instances to a new input and voting for the target class or value."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PaiYMl810_bx"},"source":["### **The most commonly used hyperparameters for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm:**\n","\n","n_neighbors: The number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction.
